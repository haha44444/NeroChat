  <h1>NeroChat</h1>
  <h3>Effective chat system with colored text, ignore, whisper and chat logging, regex filters, anti-spam for anarchic servers</h3>

</div>

**An advanced chat plugin for survival/anarchy servers.**

## About
This plugin was created to be a recreation of ChatCo from the ground up.
A lot of chat plugins usually don't get any updates anymore or have been abandoned by the developers. 

NeroChat will always get updates and contributions are welcome!

## Source
NeroChat is a fork of PistonChat from PistonMaster aimed at fixing old bugs and adding new features such as anti-spam, message filtering with REGEX, public chat formatting support and more.

Original code: https://github.com/AlexProgrammerDE/PistonChat

## Features
* Green Text
* Private Messaging
* Auto Complete when you click on a players name just like on the server 2b2t.org
* Ignore Commands
* Lots of features that 2b2t's chat plugin has.
* Regex Filter + Silent Mode
* Auto Format
* Caps Filter
* AntiSpam
* Configure that does not reset with plugin updates and multi-language support (credits: https://github.com/xGinko/BetterWorldStats)
  
This project is in active development, so if you have any feature requests or issues please submit them here on GitHub. PRs are welcome, too. :octocat:
